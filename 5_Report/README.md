## INTRODUCTION

Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver’s visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.The washer cleans the driver’s side of the windscreen whenever required.Modern windshield wipers may also be run intermittently. The intermittent wiper option cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than running constantly.

* Once the system is turned on, there is no need for the driver to activate, deactivate or adjust wiper speed under normal driving conditions.

## SOFTWARE USED

* STM CUBE IDE
* QEMU

## COMPONENTS USED

* STM32F407VGTx
* Switch
* LED
* POWER
