# WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver’s visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles.The washer cleans the driver’s side of the windscreen whenever required.Modern windshield wipers may also be run intermittently. The intermittent wiper option cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than running constantly.

## OBJECTIVE

* Rain-sensing windshield wipers detect moisture on the windshield and activate the wipers to help increase driver visibility.
* Once the system is turned on, there is no need for the driver to activate, deactivate or adjust wiper speed under normal driving condition

## SOFTWARE USED

* STM32 CUBE IDE
* QEMU

## COMPONENTS USED

* STM32F407VGTx
* Switch
* LED
* Ground
* 
## WORKING

The power supply is given to the microcontroller.Then on pressing the switch for 2 sec ignition starts and on next presses LED glows and on pressing the switch for 2 sec ignition stops.
 
## APPLICATION

* It is used in four wheeler 
* It is used in aircraft
*  It is used in train
*  It is used in six wheeler

## ADVANTAGES

* Free from wear adjustment.
*  Less power consumption.
*  Operating principle is very easy Installation is simple.
*  It is possible to operate manually/automatically by providing On/Off switch
