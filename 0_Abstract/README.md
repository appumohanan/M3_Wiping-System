# TITLE EXPLANATION

## WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM

### OBJECTIVE
    
Wiper is an important aspect that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. In this we are going to implement the car wiper system by using  STM32F407VGTx micro controller .Embbeded c language is used to run the STM32 MICROCONTROOLER and switch for swicthing operation and LED are used to as wiper.The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. The system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.The system uses a combination of impedance and rain sensor to detect rain and its intensity. The system contains a controller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals The aim of this project is to help reduce accidents that happen as a result of the driver intending to clean the windscreen when rain is falling thereby taking the attention of the driver off the road when he or she is switching on and off the wiper.  

### TOOLS USED

* STM Cube IDE
* Qemu

### OUTPUT

* On pressing the switch for 2 sec - RED LED ON (IGNITION STARTS)
* On pressing the switch for 1 sec - BLUE LED ON (WIPER RUNS)
* Onpressing the switch for 0.25 sec - GREEN LED ON (WIPER RUNS)
* On pressing the switch for 0.125 sec - ORANGE LED ON (WIPER RUNS)
* On pressing the switch for 2 sec - RED LED OFF (IGNITION STOPS)
