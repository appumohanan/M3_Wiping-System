# Requirements

## Introduction
* I have done this project with my basic knowledge on embedded c 
* For this project embedded c language is used 
* And basic knowledge of ARM architecture  is needed.
## RESEARCH

- Windscreen wiper is essential for keeping the windscreen sufficiently clean for driver’s visibility specifically for modern high speed vehicles. 
- The washer cleans the driver’s side of the windscreen whenever required.
- Modern windshield wipers may also be run intermittently. The intermittent wiper option cycles the wipers on and off every few seconds rather than running constantly.

## Benefits

- Efficient removal of dirt, water and snow
- The ability to pass the stall and snow load test.
- The wiper control switch has several modes to change wiper speed, and in many cases to turn the wipers on intermittently.
    
 ## Cost and Features
 ### Cost
     There is no cost for using this wiper system.
 ### Features
 * The vehicle's wiper blades provide an assurance of good, glare-free visibility in all weather conditions
 * It cleans the windshield and helps to see clearly during dust storms and heavy rainfall.
