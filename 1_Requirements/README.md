# Requirements

## Introduction
* I have done this project with my basic knowledge on embedded c 
* For this project embedded c language is used 
* And basic knowledge of ATmega328 architecture  is needed.
## RESEARCH

- Door sensor will sense if there anyone present or not.
- Modular Approach.
- Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system: they let you know when someone is entering your home. These devices are made up of two parts, which form a circuit when theyâ€™re kept parallel to each other. 

## Benefits
    The main aim is to develop a simple door sensor to let you know when someone is entering your home.
    
 ## Cost and Features
     There is no cost for using this sensor.
 ### Features
 * To safeguard valuable things.
 * To keep us alert when someone enters the place.
